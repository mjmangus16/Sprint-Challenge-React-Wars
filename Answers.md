1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

Class components allow you to manage state and use lifecycle methods. Functional components are more efficient if you only need to render some JSX and make use of the props being passed down from your stateful component

1.  Describe state.

State resides in your class components. This is where you would keep your variables that would need to be changed at different points inside your app. You change them with this.setState()

1.  Describe props.

Props are the properties that you pass to different components. You can pass anything as a prop whether its a state variable or a function but once it is passed, it is considered a prop inside the next component
